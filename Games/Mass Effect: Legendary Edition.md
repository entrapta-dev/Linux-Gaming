# Mass Effect: Legendary Edition *(Steam)*

## Getting it to run
At the time of writing this is a very newly released game and as such does not work with vanilla Proton *yet*. However, progress was made in the subsequent days of release and a custom Proton will fix alll major issues and make the games completely playable.  

### Required custom Proton
[Proton-6.8-GE-2](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases) is the first version that adds the tweaks and fixes for the game. Newer releases will probably work as well, or even better.  

## Blank screen when streaming to Steam link
This can be fixed by disabled the HDR options in the main menu when starting the launcher.
