## Getting it to run
At the time of writing this is a very newly released game and as such does not work with vanilla Proton *yet*. However, progress was made in the subsequent days of release and a custom Proton will fix all major issues and make the games completely playable.  

### Required custom Proton
[Proton-6.8-GE-2](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases) is the first version that adds the tweaks and fixes for the game. Newer releases will probably work as well, or even better.  

## Blank screen when streaming to Steam link
This can be fixed by disabled the HDR options in the main menu when starting the launcher.

## Stuttering
This seems to be mainly an issue with the Origin overlay and notification system. Disable what you can to improve framerate.  

## Photo Mode is not working!
It may seem no photos are taken but they are actually saved as `.bmp` files in `/steamapps/compatdata/1328670/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/BioWare/Mass Effect Legendary Edition/ScreenShots/`. There seems to be no visible or audible notification in-game to let you know you took a screenshot but it does work.  
**Tip:** Hide the UI before taking a screenshot because it will capture that into the screenshot otherwise.
