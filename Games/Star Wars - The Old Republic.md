# Star Wars: The Old Republic *(Steam)*

## Game Tweaks
Fix too fast camera speed by navigating to  
`<STEAM_LIBRARY>/steamapps/compatdata/1286830/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/SWTOR/swtor/settings/`  
and edit  
`<ACCOUNT_NAME>_Account.ini`.  

Then find  
`Controls_CameraRotationSpeed = 0.1`  
and change it to anything lower than `0.1`. A setting `0.08` seems to work well.
