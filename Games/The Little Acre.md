# The Little Acre *(Steam)*

## Error: Missing Executable
This can be fixed by making a copy of `TheLittleAcre.x86_64` and calling it `TheLittleAcre.x86`.  

## Cutscenes appear white near the end of the game.
No solid fix found.  

## Lily can't go back inside.
Visual bug when using a gamepad. The door says `A` but you actually have to press `X`.
